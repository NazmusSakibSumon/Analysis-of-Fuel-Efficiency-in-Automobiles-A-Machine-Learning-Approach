This report investigates how various car attributes influence fuel efficiency using the
”Auto MPG” dataset. Classification techniques including Linear Discriminant Analysis(
LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis(QDA), Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and
KNN were employed to predict high or low fuel efficiency based on vehicle characteristics.
The study identifies significant predictors and suggests enhancements for vehicle fuel
economy, with recommendations for future model complexity and variable inclusion.
